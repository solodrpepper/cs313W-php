            <p>
                My name is Austin Kincade and I'm a senior here at BYU-Idaho.
                I am studying Software Engineering with a minor in Mechanical
                Engineering. I hope to potentially go into machine learing and
                Artificial Intelligence. I am married to a beautiful woman 
                named Brooke and have a handsome little boy Levi, with another
                little one on the way.
